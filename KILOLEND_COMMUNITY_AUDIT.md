## 🟡 Medium Severity Issues

### M-1: Fallback Oracle Prices Don't Track Timestamps

**Location:** `KiloPriceOracle.sol:getUnderlyingPrice()`

**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**  
Pyth and Orakl modes enforce staleness checks, but fallback mode doesn't track when prices were last updated. This could theoretically allow using very old prices.

**Current Implementation:**
```solidity
// Pyth mode - ✅ Has staleness check
PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceId, stalenessThreshold);

// Orakl mode - ✅ Has staleness check  
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= stalenessThreshold);

// Fallback mode - No timestamp tracking
basePrice = fallbackPrices[underlying];
```

**Impact:**  
Low-Medium. Fallback prices are manually updated by admins, so very old prices are unlikely but theoretically possible.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public fallbackPriceTimestamp;

function setDirectPrice(address asset, uint price) public isWhitelisted {
    // ... existing validation ...
    fallbackPrices[asset] = price;
    fallbackPriceTimestamp[asset] = block.timestamp;
}
```

**Note:** Many protocols don't enforce staleness for manually-set prices. This is a design choice.

**Mitigation:** Regular price updates via monitoring. Document expected update frequency.

---

### M-2: Liquidation Buffer Boundary Behavior

**Location:** `Comptroller.sol:liquidateBorrowAllowed()`

**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**  
When shortfall exactly equals the liquidation buffer, liquidation is prevented due to `<=` check. This is likely a design choice but should be clarified.

```solidity
uint requiredShortfall = getLiquidationThresholdBuffer(borrower);
if (shortfall <= requiredShortfall) {
    return uint(Error.INSUFFICIENT_SHORTFALL);
}
// Edge case: shortfall == requiredShortfall → cannot liquidate
```

**Impact:**  
Low. Exact equality is rare in practice, and the position would become liquidatable with any additional price movement.

**Options:**
```solidity
// Option 1: Change to strict inequality
if (shortfall < requiredShortfall) {
    return uint(Error.INSUFFICIENT_SHORTFALL);
}

// Option 2: Keep as-is and document clearly
// "Liquidation requires shortfall STRICTLY GREATER than buffer threshold"
```

**Recommendation:** Choose one approach and document the behavior clearly.

---

### M-3: Price Inversion Bounds for Quote Pairs

**Location:** `KiloPriceOracle.sol:getUnderlyingPrice()`

**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**  
Price inversion for quote pairs (e.g., KRW/USD → USD/KRW) lacks bounds validation. Extremely small or large base prices could cause issues.

```solidity
if (invertMode[underlying]) {
    require(basePrice > 0, "Price must be positive");
    return 1e36 / basePrice;  // No bounds on result
}
```

**Example Problem:**
- If basePrice accidentally set to 1 (instead of expected ~1200 for KRW/USD)
- Result: 1e36 / 1 = 1e36 (nonsensical value)

**Impact:**  
Low-Medium. Only affects assets using inverted mode. Requires price misconfiguration.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
if (invertMode[underlying]) {
    require(basePrice > 0, "Price must be positive");
    require(basePrice >= 1e10, "Base price too small");
    
    uint256 inverted = 1e36 / basePrice;
    require(inverted <= 1e30, "Inverted price too large");
    
    return inverted;
}
```

**Note:** Only relevant if using inverted price pairs. Not needed for standard USD prices.

---

## 🔵 Low Severity Issues

### L-1: Additional Event Emissions

**Severity:** 🔵 Low

**Description:** Some state changes could benefit from more detailed events for monitoring.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
event InitialPriceSet(address indexed asset, uint256 price);
event WhitelistStatusChanged(address indexed user, bool status);
event StalenessThresholdChanged(uint256 oldThreshold, uint256 newThreshold);
```

**Status:** Nice-to-have for enhanced monitoring

---

### L-2: Account Asset Enumeration Gas Limits

**Severity:** 🔵 Low

**Description:** Users with many markets could theoretically hit gas limits during liquidity calculations.

**Current State:**
- `maxAssets` parameter exists in storage but not strictly enforced
- Compound V2 uses same pattern
- Practical limit ~20 markets before gas issues

**Recommendation:** Document recommended maximum or add enforcement:
```solidity
function addToMarketInternal(CToken cToken, address borrower) internal returns (Error) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    require(accountAssets[borrower].length < maxAssets, "too many assets");
    
    accountAssets[borrower].push(cToken);
}
```

**Status:** Monitor - inherited from Compound V2, low risk

---

### L-3: Gas Optimization Opportunities

**Severity:** 🔵 Low

**Description:** Minor gas optimizations possible throughout the codebase.

**Examples:**
```solidity
// Cache storage reads
Market storage market = markets[address(asset)];
uint256 cf = market.collateralFactorMantissa;

// Remove redundant returns
function redeemAllowed(...) external returns (uint) {
    return redeemAllowedInternal(...);  // Simplified
}

// Pack structs efficiently
struct Market {
    bool isListed;           // 1 byte
    uint248 reserved;        // Pack with bool
    uint collateralFactor;   // 32 bytes
}
```

**Status:** Optimize in future upgrades, not critical

---

## ✅ Security Strengths

### 1. ✅ Battle-Tested Compound V2 Foundation
Built on proven code with millions in TVL and years of security track record. Minimal modifications to core logic.

### 2. ✅ KILO Feature Caps Properly Implemented
```solidity
// ✅ Discount capped at 20% - cannot be bypassed
MAX_BORROW_DISCOUNT_BPS = 2000
return discountBps > MAX_BORROW_DISCOUNT_BPS ? MAX_BORROW_DISCOUNT_BPS : discountBps;

// ✅ Buffer capped at 10% - cannot be bypassed
MAX_LIQUIDATION_BUFFER_MANTISSA = 10e16
return bufferMantissa > MAX_LIQUIDATION_BUFFER_MANTISSA ? MAX_LIQUIDATION_BUFFER_MANTISSA : bufferMantissa;
```

### 3. ✅ Oracle Price Protections Well-Designed
```solidity
// ✅ Global price bounds
MIN_PRICE = 1e6      // $0.000001
MAX_PRICE = 1e24     // $1,000,000

// ✅ 1-hour timelock between updates
PRICE_UPDATE_DELAY = 1 hours

// ✅ 20% maximum price change
MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION_BPS = 2000

// ✅ Whitelist required
modifier isWhitelisted()
```

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Emergency Pause
All critical operations properly protected:
```solidity
modifier whenNotEmergencyPaused() {
    require(!emergencyPaused, "protocol emergency paused");
    _;
}

// Applied to: mint, borrow, liquidate, redeem, transfer
```

### 5. ✅ Non-Reentrancy Protection
```solidity
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(_notEntered, "re-entered");
    _notEntered = false;
    _;
    _notEntered = true;
}
// Applied to all entry points: mint, redeem, borrow, repay, liquidate
```

### 6. ✅ Safe External Call Handling
```solidity
// KILO staking calls use try-catch with safe fallbacks
try kiloStaking.getBorrowRateDiscount(borrower) returns (uint discountBps) {
    return discountBps > MAX ? MAX : discountBps;
} catch {
    return 0;  // Safe fallback, cannot DOS protocol
}
```

### 7. ✅ Parameter Bounds Validation
All critical parameters have strict min/max bounds:
```solidity
// Collateral factors: 0-90%
collateralFactorMaxMantissa = 0.9e18

// Liquidation incentive: 100-115%
liquidationIncentiveMinMantissa = 1.0e18
liquidationIncentiveMaxMantissa = 1.15e18

// Close factor: 5-90%
closeFactorMinMantissa = 0.05e18
closeFactorMaxMantissa = 0.9e18
```

### 8. ✅ Comprehensive Access Controls
Multiple protection layers:
- Admin functions protected by access modifiers
- Pause guardian role for emergency actions
- Borrow cap guardian for quick adjustments
- Whitelist for oracle price updates
- Two-step admin transfer process

### 9. ✅ Multiple Oracle Modes
Flexibility and resilience against oracle failures:
- **Pyth Network** (primary) - Decentralized, low-latency
- **Orakl Network** (backup) - Regional price feeds
- **Fallback mode** (manual) - Emergency fallback

### 10. ✅ Detailed Event Emissions
Comprehensive events for monitoring:
```solidity
event MarketListed(CToken cToken);
event MarketEntered(CToken cToken, address account);
event NewCollateralFactor(CToken cToken, uint oldCF, uint newCF);
event NewPriceOracle(PriceOracle oldOracle, PriceOracle newOracle);
event ActionPaused(string action, bool pauseState);
event PricePosted(address asset, uint oldPrice, uint reqPrice, uint newPrice);
// ... and many more
```

### 11. ✅ Zero Address Checks on Critical Functions
```solidity
function addToWhitelist(address user) external onlyOwner {
    require(user != address(0), "Cannot whitelist zero address");
    whitelist[user] = true;
}

function _setPendingAdmin(address payable newPendingAdmin) external {
    // Prevents setting zero address as admin
    require(newPendingAdmin != address(0), "invalid address");
}
```

### 12. ✅ Safe Math Operations
Using Solidity ^0.8.10 with built-in overflow/underflow protection, plus explicit checks where needed.
